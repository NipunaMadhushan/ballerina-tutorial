# Session 3

## Overview 

- GraphQL with Ballerina
- Testing Ballerina code
- Ballerina connectors and package management
- Observability with Ballerina

These areas will be covered via an implementation of a GraphQL backend in Ballerina, for `Reviewed!`, a platform to review places.

## Backend implementation for `Reviewed!`

`Reviewed!` let's you 
- retrieve all places for which reviews can be done, with city, country, rating, and fee
- retrieve details of a specific place, including city, country, rating, fee, time zone, city population, and all the current reviews for the place
- retrieve all the reviews by a particular author
    - a review consists of a rating and review content for a particular place

### Developing the GraphQL backend

#### Level 0 - Initial data

- Branch - https://github.com/wso2con2024/ballerina-tutorial/tree/session-3-level-0

- Consists of in-memory data to get started with the GraphQL implementation.

- Three main entities: Place, Author, and Review

    ![Entity relationships](./backend/resources/er-diagram.jpeg)

- Use this to implement level 1.

    i. return all places with data in the places table - id, name, city, country, and entryFee

    ii. incorporate population and time zone information from https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-500/api/?disjunctive.country 

    - URL - https://public.opendatasoft.com/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets
    - path - string `/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-500/records?refine=name:${
        city}&refine=country:${country}`
